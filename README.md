week1.ipynb contains a framework for the simulation of simple normal form games. I have created an example game based on player attributes - size and speed where a player 
can have a mixed strategy which is a probability distribution over [dodge, attack]. The payoffs are decided based on the attributes of both players

doves_and_hawks.ipynb is my attempt at recreating the simulation in Primer's video - https://youtu.be/YNMkADpvO4w?si=2idxxXnXTdAl8mCA : Simulating the evolution of aggression. 
Where there are two classes of players - hawks and doves, and they roam a random environment fighting over randomly distributed particles of food. We aim to see the equillibrium 
populations of both the player classes and see if they hold consistent with our theoretical expectations. 
This framework can be further expanded to simulate more complex players with more attributes like speed, strength, resistance and many more and simulate a wider range of 
behaviour.
